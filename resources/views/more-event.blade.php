                    <p>Nigeria is a multi-ethnic and culturally diverse society that has witnessed conflicts arising from this ethnic and cultural diversity. Our Cultural diversity which, ordinarily should be regarded as a gift of God has in recent times become a threat to unity and peaceful co-existence, progress and stable development. Experiences have shown that our cultures are in fact been pushed beyond their limits of tolerance in manners that suggest danger. The entire scenario is begging for national integration. And to this effect, the entire management and students of St. Augustine’s College Du, Jos on Saturday, 24th March, 2018 will be marking her Cultural Day Celebration with chains of spectacular cultural expositions. The event will commemorate our cultures and other cultures beyond our borders. It is our hope that exposing our students to events such as this will enhance national integration and make meaningful impact in the nation.</p>

                    <p>The Cultural Day Celebration is twinned with the Ground Breaking Ceremony of a world class refectory (Dinning Hall). And we appeal to parents, friends, business associates to assist the school in bringing this dream to fruition.</p>
